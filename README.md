# SFTP Upload Action (v3)

[🇨🇳 简体中文](./README_zh.md)

A GitHub Action to upload files to a server via SFTP.

## Features (v3)
*   🚀 **High Performance**: Python-based implementation with configurable concurrency.
*   🧠 **Smart Skip**: Uses content hash (`MD5`) to skip unchanged files.
*   📂 **State Management**: Maintains a `.sftp_upload_action_hashes` file on the server to track file states without needing SSH shell access.
*   🔒 **Secure**: Supports password and private key authentication.

## Example Usage

```yaml
name: Deploy
on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Upload via SFTP
        uses: wangyucode/sftp-upload-action@v3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
          localDir: 'dist'
          remoteDir: '/var/www/html'
          concurrency: 10
```

## Migrating from v2 to v3

Version 3 is a complete rewrite in Python to improve performance and reliability.

### Key Changes
1.  **Platform**: Switched from Node.js to Python (Composite Action).
2.  **Smart Skipping**: v2 used file size/timestamp. v3 uses **Content Hash** (MD5) stored in a metadata file `.sftp_upload_action_hashes` on the server. This ensures that only truly changed files are uploaded, even if timestamps change (common in CI builds).
3.  **Concurrency**: Added `concurrency` input to control parallel uploads (default: 4).

> The action now creates a `.sftp_upload_action_hashes` file in the `remoteDir`. Do not delete this file if you want the "Smart Skip" feature to work.

### Migration Steps
1.  Just update the version tag to `@v3` in your workflow.
2.  Enjoy faster uploads!
